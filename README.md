# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

## Overview 
For this project, I working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Tools
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook

## Results
I noticed that all P-values are higher than (0.05) which means the null hypothesis can not be rejected.
So ther is no difference of maintain the old page or implement the new page.
Also when we considering Different countries there is no statistics differnce.
